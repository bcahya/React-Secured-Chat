# React-Secured-Chat
React&Redux app that connects to Elixir Phoenix backend. Users can register, create rooms, and chat with others. 
I added many comments so it will be easy to understand. 
You'll need to install Elixir and Phoenix and to clone the "Elixir-Secured-Chat" Repo in order to play with everything. 
As for this Repo, just download/clone, run "npm install" and "npm start".
